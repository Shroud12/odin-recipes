        <p>
            <ol>
                <li> Firstly roughly dice your onions, chillies and tomatoes and set them aside </li>
                <li> Open your stove on medium-low heat and place a pan.</li>
                <li> Pour 2 tablespoons of mustard oil and let it heat up a little.</li>
                <li> After heating up the oil throw in the chicken.</li>
                <li> Cook the chicken thoroughly until it has a little golden crust on the outside. Around 15-16 minutes.</li>
                <li> Remove the chicken in a bowl and set it aside for now.</li>
                <li> In the same pan add 1 tablespoon of mustard oil.</li>
                <li> Now pour in your roughly choped onions first.</li>
                <li> Add a pinch of salt to help wilt the onions faster.</li>
                <li> Add the chillies to the onions and also add tumeric to give it some color.</li>
                <li> Cook the onions till the oil spererates from it and remember to keep on stirring them to prevent them from burning.</li>
                <li> Now add in the tomatoes and again a small pinch of salt to help it cook faster. Cook them weel otherwise your curry will taste like raw tomatoes</li>
                <li> Cook the tomatoes till it completely wilts and chunks start disappearaing.</li>
                <li> Now toss in the chicken that you set aside to the pan. Since we already cooked the chicken before we will only cook it for 6-7 more minutes.</li>
                <li> Finally add the chicken masala and the chilly powder to the curry and throughly mix them. Cook it for additional 2-3 minutes.</li>
                <li> The chicken curry is now ready. You can eat it with a serving of rice or with flat-breads</li>
